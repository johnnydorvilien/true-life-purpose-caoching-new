								Life coaching is a synergistic relationship between an accredited
								life coach and a client designed to tap into your full potential.
								Just as Olympic athletes wouldn’t think of training without the added
								insight, objective perspective and enthusiastic support of an athletic coach,
								many of today’s most successful business leaders, professionals, executives,
								entrepreneurs and CEOs use the services of a life coach to take their lives,
								careers, or businesses to the next level. At LifeCoach.com we have an international
								directory of accredited life coaches who can address your personal and business
								coaching needs for both your personal and professional life.

											Thomas Leonard, an American financial planner, is generally acknowledged as 
											the first person to develop coaching as a profession in the 1980s and the history 
											of life coaching today really starts with him.
										</p>

										<p>
											Leonard observed that his clients, though emotionally stable and hardly needing therapy, 
											wanted more from him than just the usual tips on how to invest and safeguard their incomes.
										</p>

										<p>
											They wanted help in organising their lives better and planning and achieving their goals.
										</p>

										<p>
											His groundbreaking s book The Portable Coach an invaluable resource to have on your life 
											coaching shelf, full of really useful information and processes to us with your clients .   
											You can review and buy it on Amazon
										</p>

										<p>
											So Leonard’s career gradually shifted from financial planning to full-time developing of the 
											techniques which were to become his coaching methodolgy.  At the time he called it “life-planning”.
										</p>
										<p>
											Within a few years, he was coaching and training people in those specific coaching skills which were 
											complimentary but quite different to those practiced by therapists, mentors and consultants.

											One of the most common pieces of advice that you'll hear from nearly all self-help guru's is 
											that the fastest way to success is to find a coach, mentor or role model that can help you 
											achieve your goal much faster.  Have you heard this before?  I know I have.  Everyone from 
											Tony Robbins, Brian Tracy, and countless other “guru's” preach the same advice.
										</p>

										<p>
											Yet, most people don't have a life coach.  They resist it.  They think that they can “do it on 
											their own” and often aren't willing to make that investment in themselves.  In my opinion, 
											this is a trap that most people fall into that holds them back from having massive success in their lives.  
											It's something that held me back for years, and if I could go back in time, I would have immediately 
											found a life coach at the start of my journey.  It would have saved me so much stress, time, 
											and money in the long-run.  I'm thankful I've learned my lessons now and have had several coaches 
											and mentors in my life.

												Coaches have the ability to view things from afar —
												in what some call ‘helicopter vision’ — and to shed
												new light on difficult situations. Often they can act as a
												sounding board through tough decisions, help sharpen skills, and motivate.
											</p>
	
											<p>
												An article in Public Management revealed a study where training alone was
												compared to life coaching combined with training. The study showed that
												training alone increased productivity by 22.4% while training combined with
												weekly life coaching increased productivity by 88%. Here is why:
											</p>
	
											<p>
												1) Accountability. Most life coaches have three calls a month with their clients.
												This regularly scheduled call prompts clients to get more done than they would if
												left to their own devices. Think about it, if you work out with a personal trainer
												at the gym, you work much harder than on your own. Clients take bigger actions,
												set bigger goals and think bigger when they work with a professional coach.
											</p>
	
											<p>
												2) Expertise. The trained life coach knows how to help you set the right goals,
												make more money, and structure your personal and professional life to achieve
												greater productivity with less effort. You’ll achieve more in less time with the
												input of an accredited Life Coach on your side.
											</p>
	
											<p>
												3) Delivery. A well-trained coach knows how to use the right words so that you are
												naturally motivated. It doesn’t take brow-beating or nagging when you are working
												with a skilled life coach. Coaching typically works best with a weekly call so clients
												have time to integrate new ways of thinking and take action each week toward their goals.
												Most life coaching is done by phone and delivered in half hour to one hour coaching calls.
												The experience is challenging and uplifting. You’ll look forward to your weekly calls with
												your life coach.
